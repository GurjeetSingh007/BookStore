Assignment 2

Part 1:
         Earlier started the project but failed in initialising it in github because i just made git locally due to which remote repository is not added in it so,
         I deleted all files and now starting again.

4:13pm - Started the assignment 2 and just completed first commit.
4:23pm - Commented sign in flag in Startup.cs file as per requirement. 
4:49pm - Did the test debugging but it did not work in the browser so I turned sslPort into comment. Then again, I test debugging and now it is working.
5:21pm  - Replacing the bootstap file existing in the project with the bootstrap.css downloaded from bootswatch.com and selected the slate theme. Replacing
         the the existing site.css with the given css file in blackboard.Then updated the filename from bootstrap.min.css to bootstrap.css and also changed
         the light to dark and bg-white to bg-primary and also removed the text dark from line 23 & 25. Also, updated _LoginPartial.cshtml file by removing
         text-dark from it. Run the file and it works.
5:25pm - As i am doing the assignment in college lab so now going to home and will prepare my food and then start again.
