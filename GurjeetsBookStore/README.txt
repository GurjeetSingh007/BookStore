Assignment 2

Part 1:
Earlier started the project but failed in initialising it in github because i just made git locally due to which remote repository is not added in it so, I deleted all files and now starting again.
4:13pm - Started the assignment 2 and just completed first commit.
4:23pm - Commented sign in flag in Startup.cs file as per requirement. 
4:49pm - Did the test debugging but it did not work in the browser so I turned sslPort into comment. Then again, I test debugging and now it is working.
